## Game Description: 
It's a game where you work as a waiter in restaurant. Unfortunately, you are the only waiter worked there. All what you should do is direct the customers in the left side of the restaurant to one of the four tables there. Then you should take thier orders to the chef. Finally, deliver the food back to that table. However, you should be careful because costumers can be angry sometimes and they take off early. you should be quick and satisfy all of costumers' needs.
